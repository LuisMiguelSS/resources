# Material-Colored icons and images
This repository includes images and icons for you to use and avoid wasting time creating them.

## But which formats do can I find here?
Most of them will be in PNG format, but this will be periodically be updated with SVGs, to make them look good with no more effort.

## How does this work?
Well, you'll be able to find each icon depending on the size you want it. Eventually each icon would be in almost all used sizes. Just use their URL in this repository or download them!

### NOTE-:
I'll do my best to make a website so you can check which one you like/prefer to make it even easier! - TODO
